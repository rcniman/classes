## Meeting date: None!
## About the week
- Are you ready to learn to go back to school?
- Are you ready to rock?

Here are a few songs about school and summer vacation to get you ready for class. Take a listen and let me know which was your favorite. Or do you know of another song about school that I should add to my playlist? Let me know by emailing me or telling me on the first day of class.
## Playlists of the week

*Note: This is a pretty clean playlist. The only song with swear words is the last song on the list, by Rage Against the Machine.*
