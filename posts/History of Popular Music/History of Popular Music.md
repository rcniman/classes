## Learning objectives
Our goals for this class are to **have a lot of fun** and:
 - **Recognize** and list **major** styles, time periods, and individuals in the history of popular music
 - **Relate** songs, musicians, and styles of music to social, political, and technological events
 - When listing to a new song, **identify** its place in musical history and **interpret** its meaning and significance
 - In group discussions and optional writing assignments, **analyze** lyrics, **categorize** songs into playlists of your own, and **evaluate** the importance of songs and musicians
## Course description

4th to 8th grade: We will explore the history of popular music, beginning with the invention of the radio and phonograph, and trace its development to today. We will explore a variety of sub-genres as we move through time and tie music to the political and social events of the time. 

While historical context and tidbits will be shared along the way, this will mainly be an interactive class: we will listen to music, watch music videos and snippets of documentaries, and interact with ancient technologies like the CD and the Walkman. 

Students will be encouraged to listen to music outside of class and share their favorite finds with their classmates. 

Optional reading and writing assignments will also be assigned for those that would like to incorporate this class into the rest of their homeschool curriculum. In addition to developing students’ listening and analysis skills, the course will incorporate reading with pieces of music journalism and music reviews. And students will be encouraged to write as they take on the role of a rock journalist themselves, producing a music review, musical essay, or interview.

Students who want to follow along should buy the book Turn It Up!: A pitch-perfect history of music that rocked the world.

Please note: While we will avoid playing the most explicit songs in class, some mature language or subject matter may appear from time to time. Students should be able to handle hearing this language.

Students should also have:
- A mind open to new musical styles
- Access to music through something like a streaming service, CDs from the library, YouTube, or well-stocked shelves at home
