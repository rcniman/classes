## Welcome to Rising Roots!

Well, specifically my classes there. For 2023-4, I'm teaching two classes:
- [History of Popular Music](History of Popular Music/History of Popular Music)
- [Puzzlemasters](Puzzlemasters)



## Getting started
### I don't need this

Steps to run it on your local machine:
1. Clone this [Github repo](https://github.com/TuanManhCao/digital-garden)
2. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) package manager 
3. Copy all of your **markdown** file (`.md` only) and folder to `/posts/` **except** `/posts/index.md` file
4. Go to root folder of your project, run `yarn && yarn run dev`
5. Open this link in your browser http://localhost:3000/

### Publish to the internet

Setup environment (with Netlify)
1. Create your Github account and clone [my repository](https://github.com/TuanManhCao/digital-garden)
2. Create Netlify account and follow [this instruction](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/11/30/how-to-deploy-next.js-sites-to-netlify/) 


Your normal workflow for publishing content, after initial setup is:
1. Simply writing your content in Obisidian (or your favourite Markdown editor)
2. Commit your changes and Push it to your Github repo

These are just some basic features for MindStone v1, many more are coming (if I find enough of interest and this will probably a premium/paid option):
- 沁ｯ窶グbsidian, Notion, VSCode Plugin 
- 沁ｯ窶ケage Preview (like Obsidian Core plugin)
- 沁ｯ窶アndy Sliding pane
- 沁ｯ窶ェull text search with `Cmd + K`
- 沁ｯ窶オnfinite canvas for browsing through notes and connections

### Some know issues
This an early version of MindStone, which mean there are bugs and issues. Below are some known issues, that I plan to work on:
- Image link in wiki link style is not supported yet. `![[Image_link.png]]` will not work yet.  see work around below
- Graphview does not load when clicking on side-bar or click node on graphview, browser reload will refresh it state
- Graph view layout and interaction is still very rough. More UI/UX improvements are needed.
- Transclusion is not working yet.
